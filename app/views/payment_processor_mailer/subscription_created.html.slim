  | Hi #{@profile.first_name.try(:titleize)}!
  br
  br
  | Thanks for choosing TravelTrunk! Your vacation savings plan has officially begun.
  br
  br
  | You've started saving #{number_to_currency(@bank_account.try(:amount_transfer).to_f)} every #{payment_frequency_label(@bank_account.try(:transfer_frequency))}. Nice! From here on, TravelTrunk will charge your credit card on file #{currency_in_usd(@subscription.amount)}, adding this new amount to your travel savings every #{payment_frequency_label(@bank_account.try(:transfer_frequency))}.
  br
  br
  | Your adventure just got closerâ€¦
  br
  br
  | Congrats!
